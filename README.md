# Car Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict car prices based on various features such as brand, model, year, mileage, and other attributes. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and model-building notebooks, along with a sample database and dependencies for reproducibility.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning pipelines
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebooks
- Machine learning model implementation for price prediction
- Structured project layout for reproducibility and scalability

## Quick Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vincent4u/car_price_prediction1.git
````

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd car_price_prediction1
```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes

* `.env` and large data files (`data/`, `db/`) are ignored and not included in the repository.
* Jupyter notebooks contain the step-by-step workflow for data exploration, preprocessing, and model building.

If you want, I can **also add a small example usage section** showing how someone could run a notebook or script to predict a car price — this makes it **GitHub-ready and professional** for sharing or job portfolios.  

Do you want me to do that next?
